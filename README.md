# dcg - Deep Causal Graphs

This repository contains all three libraries necessary for training Deep Causal Graphs (DCG),
models for causal query estimation without estimands.

The "paper" release includes a zip file with all experiments included in the paper
"Estimand-Agnostic Causal Query Estimation with Deep Causal Graphs".


# Installation

Install all three libraries here included with pip (preferably using a virtual environment) in the following order:

```
pip3 install -e torch-misc
pip3 install -e flow
pip3 install -e dcg
```


# Tutorial
