Deep Causal Graphs

This project implements Deep Causal Graphs and contains
several implementations of its Deep Causal Unit (DCU), 
from distributional DCUs to Normalizing Causal Flows.

This technique can model Structural Causal Models
with complex data distributions, and be used to perform
causal inference from interventions to counterfactuals.
