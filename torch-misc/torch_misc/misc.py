    r"""Return the given nodes in topological order.

    Nodes will be sorted in topological order and, secondly, if possible, 
    in their own order defined by \_\_lt\_\_ or \_\_gt\_\_.

    Args:
        nodes (list): list of nodes to sort. Each node must be hashable.
        parents (dict): dict { node: parents } with each node's parents.
        return_levels (bool): whether to also return the node level.
        
    Returns: 
        list with all nodes in topological order, if return_levels is False.
        If return_levels is True, the resulting list contains tuples
        (level, nodes) with level an int indicating the topological level
        and nodes a list with all nodes in that level.
