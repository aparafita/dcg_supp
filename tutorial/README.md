In order to run the tutorial notebook, we first need to generate the synthetic dataset.

Go to the data/ folder and execute the "Create Dataset.ipynb" notebook first. 
It will create three files: the graph definition, the training dataset and the test dataset.

Remember that you need to have installed the three libraries first.

After this, you can go ahead and read/execute the "Tutorial.ipynb" notebook.
